<h1><font face="augie">Whiz Kid Technomagic Fast CRC-32 Routines</font></h1>
<p>
   This is a Unix port of fast assembly language routines for CRC-32 calculation
   I originally wrote in 1997 as a Windows 95 DLL.
</p>
<p>
   The routines in the original DLL calculated only one type of CRC-32, namely
   the traditional CRC used by Zmodem, Opus, Ethernet, etc.
</p>
<p>
   This Unix port also contains POSIX 1003.2 CRC routines.
</p>
<p>To distinguish between the two, the traditional routine names start with
   <b>ecrc</b> (“Ethernet CRC”). The POSIX routine names start with <b>pcrc</b>.
</p>
<h2>Calculating traditional CRC-32</h2>
<p>
   To calculate CRC-32, we must first initialize CRC to 0xFFFFFFFF. The
   <i>ecrcinit</i> function does that. Then we need to calculate an
   intermediate CRC-32 for each byte in the stream of bytes we are working with,
   using the <i>ecrc</i> function. After that, we need to convert the result
   to the final CRC-32. The <i>ecrcfinish</i> function performs this operation.
</p>
<h2>Calculating POSIX CRC</h2>
<p>
   We start by initializing CRC to 0. The <i>pcrcinit</i> function does just that.
   We then calculate intermediate CRC for each byte of the stream using the
   <i>pcrc</i> function. Finally, we add significant bytes of the stream length
   to our CRC calculation, and reverse the bits of the result. We can use the
   <i>pcrcfinish</i> function for this purpose.
</p>
<h2>The fast CRC-32 routines</h2>
<p>
   These routines are written in Intel assembly language and work on anything
   from i386 on. Here is a quick reference:
</p>
<b><pre>
crc_t ecrcinit(void);
crc_t pcrcinit(void);
</pre></b>
<p>
   These two functions are implemented as macros, unless you define
   <b>NOCRCMACROS</b> before including <i>fastcrc.h</i>. They simply return
   0xFFFFFFFF or 0, respectively.
</p>
<b><pre>
crc_t ecrcfinish(crc_t const crc);
crc_t pcrcfinish(crc_t const crc, unsigned int numbytes);
</pre></b>
<p>
   The first one is also a macro (under the same conditions). It converts the
   result of all intermediate calculations into final CRC-32 by simply
   reverting all of its bits.
</p>
<p>
   The second one is a function. It adds the significant bytes of the size of
   the stream (passed to it in <i>numbytes</i>) to the CRC, then reverts the
   bits of the result.
</p>
<b><pre>
crc_t ecrc(crc_t const oldcrc, unsigned char const abyte);
crc_t pcrc(crc_t const oldcrc, unsigned char const abyte);
</pre></b>
   These functions are the work horse that calculates intermediate CRC on
   individual bytes of a stream. Before processesing the first byte,
   <i>ecrcinit</i> or <i>pcrcinit</i> must be called. At the end,
   <i>ecrcfinish</i> or <i>pcrcfinish</i> are called for final wrapup.
</p>
<p>
   Example:
</p>
<font color=blue><b><pre>
#include &lt;fastcrc.h&gt;

crc_t checkstream(unsigned char *stream, unsigned int streamsize) {
	unsigned int i;
	crc_t crc;

	crc = ecrcinit();

	for (i = 0; i < streamsize; i++)
		crc = ecrc(crc, stream[i]);

	return crcfinish(crc);
}
</pre></b></font>
<b><pre>
crc_t ecrcpartial(crc_t const oldcrc, unsigned char const * const stream,
   unsigned int const streamsize);
crc_t pcrcpartial(crc_t const oldcrc, unsigned char const * const stream,
   unsigned int const streamsize);
</pre></b>
<p>
   These functions calculate intermediate CRC on a partial stream of bytes.
   It is necessary to call the appropriate <i>init</i> and <i>finish</i>
   functions before they are used for the first time and after the last use.
</p>
<p>
   Example:
</p>
<font color=blue><b><pre>
#include &lt;fastcrc.h&gt;

crc_t checkstreams(unsigned char *stream1, unsigned int streamsize1,
	unsigned char *stream2, unsigned int streamsize2) {

	crc_t crc = pcrcinit();

	crc = pcrcpartial(crc, stream1, streamsize1);
	crc = pcrcpartial(crc, stream2, streamsize2);

	return pcrcfinish(crc);
}
</pre></b></font>
<p>
   If you like terse but hard-to-read code, you could change that example to:
</p>
<font color=blue><b><pre>
#include &lt;fastcrc.h&gt;

crc_t checkstreams2(unsigned char *stream1, unsigned int streamsize1,
	unsigned char *stream2, unsigned int streamsize2) {

	return pcrcfinish(pcrcpartial(pcrcpartial(pcrcinit(),
		stream1, streamsize1), stream2, streamsize2));
}
</pre></b></font>
<b><pre>
crc_t ecrcarray(unsigned char const * const stream, unsigned int const
   streamsize);
crc_t pcrcarray(unsigned char const * const stream, unsigned int const
   streamsize);
</pre></b>
<p>
   These functions are used on a complete stream of bytes. They do all
   necessary initialization and finalization internally. Their functionally
   is identical to the <i>checkstream()</i> example above.
</p>
<p>
   Example:
</p>
<font color=blue><b><pre>
#include &lt;fastcrc.h&gt;

crc_t checkstream2(unsigned char *stream, unsigned int streamsize) {

	return ecrcarray(stream, streamsize);
}
</pre></b></font>
<h2>Sample program</h2>
<p>
   A sample program, <b>fc.c</b>, is included with the routines. This program
   calculates both types of CRC of a file passed to it through the command line.
   If no file is specified, it reads <i>stdin</i> and calculates the CRC of
   whatever is entered. It also reports the number of bytes in the file.
</p>
<h2>Multilingual interface</h2>
<p>
   All routines are callable by programs using the C calling convention of
   passing parameters on the stack, pushing them from right to left, and
   having the caller clean up the stack. It does not matter whether the C
   compiler prepends function names with an underscore (some do, some do not).
</p>
<p>
   The routines can also be called by programs using the Pascal convention of
   converting the function name to capital letters, passing parameters on the
   stack, pushing them from left to right, and having the routines themselves
   clean up the stack.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, assembly language programs may pass parameters in registers. See
   the source code for details.
